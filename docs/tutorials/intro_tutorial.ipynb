    "# Mesa-Geo Introductory Model \n",
    "\n",
    "To overview the critical parts of Mesa-Geo this tutorial uses the pandemic modelling approach known as a S(usceptible), I(infected) and R(ecovered) or SIR model. \n",
    "\n",
    "Components of the model are:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Agents:** Each agent in the model represents an individual in the population. Agents have states of susceptible, infected, recovered, or dead. The Agents are point agents, randomly placed into the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Environment:** The environment is a set of polygons of a few Toronto neighborhoods.   \n",
    "\n",
    "**Interaction Rules:** Susceptible agents can become infected with a certain probability, if they come into contact with infected agents. Infected agents then recover after a certain period or perish based on a probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parameters:** \n",
    "- Population Size (number of human agents in the model)\n",
    "- Initial Infection (percent of the population initial infected)\n",
    "- Exposure Distance (proximity suscpetible agents must be to infected agents to possibly get infected)\n",
    "- Infection Risk (probability of becoming infected)\n",
    "- Recovery Rate (time infection lasts)\n",
    "- Mobility (distance agent moves)\n",
    "\n",
    "**The tutorial then proceeds in three parts:** \n",
    "- Part 1 Create the Basic Model \n",
    "- Part 2 Add Agent Behaviors and Model Complexity \n",
    "- Part 3 Add Visualizations and Interface\n",

    "To create the SIR dynamics we need the agents move, determine if they have been exposed and if they have process the probability of them being infected and possibly dying. \n",
    "\n",
    "To do this we will update our step function. The step function logic uses the agent's `atype` to determine what actions to process\n",
    "\n",
    "**Part 1**\n",
    "\n",
    "If the PersonAgent `atype` is susceptible, then we need to identify all PersonAgent's neighbors within the exposure distance. To do this, we will use Mesa-Geo's `get_neighbors_within_distance` function which takes 2 parameters, the agent, and a distance, which in this case is the model parameter for exposure distance in meters. This creates a list of PersonAgents within that distance. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `get_neighbors_within_distance` [function](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa-geo/blob/56c598486e0f58f3626d9951796998d38bbab0b5/mesa_geo/geospace.py#L197) has two keyword arguments `center` and `relation`. `center` takes `True` or `False` on whether to include the center, it is set to `False` and measures as a buffer around the agent's geometry. If `True` it measures from the Center of the point. `relation` is defaulted to `intersects` but can take any common spatial relationship, such as `contains`, `within`, `touches`, `crosses`\n",
    "\n",
    "The step function then iterates through the list of neighbors to see if any agents are infected. If so it does a probabilistic comparison of a random float compared to the agents infection risk and if `True` the agent becomes infected and the iteration ends.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Part 2**\n",
    "\n",
    "If the agent `atype` is infected, then the step function does comparisons. First, it sees how many steps the agent has been infected. To track this the PersonAgent got a new attribute counter which is `steps_infected`. If the steps are greater than or equal to their recovery rate, the agent is recovered, if not then the function does a probabilistic comparison with the agents death risk to see if the agent dies. If neither of these things happen the `steps_infected` increases by one.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Part 3**\n",
    "\n",
    "The next part is if the agent `atype` is not dead then the agent moves. For this we randomly get an integer for the x any (lat and long) between their negative `mobility_range` and positive `mobility range`. We pass these two integers into the helper function `move_point` and then update the agents geometry with this new point. \n",
