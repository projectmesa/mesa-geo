### üìú Documentation improvements

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa-geo/compare/v0.9.0a0...v0.9.0a1

# 0.9.0a0 (2024-09-27)
## Highlights
The Mesa-geo `v0.9.0a0` pre-release is the first Mesa-geo version compatible with Mesa 3.0.

One of the most notable changes is the automatic assignment of unique IDs to agents. This eliminates the need for manual ID specification, simplifying agent creation. For example, where you previously might have initialized an agent with:

```python
agent = MyGeoAgent(unique_id=1, model=model, geometry=point, crs="EPSG:4326")
```

You now simply omit the `unique_id`:

```python
agent = MyGeoAgent(model=model, geometry=point, crs="EPSG:4326")
```

Mesa-geo can now directly use Mesa 3.0's SolaraViz visualisation, with an additional `make_geospace_leaflet` method to support geospaces. The new visualization can be used like:

```python
from mesa.visualization import SolaraViz
import mesa_geo.visualization as mgv

model = GeoSIR()
SolaraViz(
    model,
    name="GeoSIR",
    components=[
        mgv.make_geospace_leaflet(SIR_draw, zoom=12, scroll_wheel_zoom=False),
        mesa.visualization.make_plot_measure(["infected", "susceptible", "recovered", "dead"]),
        mesa.visualization.make_plot_measure(["safe", "hotspot"]),
    ]
)
```

The `v0.9.0a0` pre-release is a snapshot release to allow starting testing against Mesa 3.0, and might introduce new breaking changes in upcoming (pre-)releases.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa-geo/compare/v0.8.1...v0.9.0a0

# 0.8.1 (2024-09-03)
## Highlights
Mesa-Geo 0.8.1 is a small patch release containing a single feature, a documentation update and a bug fixed.

The real novelty is that from now on, all GIS examples on [Mesa-examples](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa-examples) are tested in CI against Mesa-Geo. We fixed 16 bugs in the 7 GIS example models ([mesa-examples#172](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa-examples/issues/172)), which are now available on two branches:
- On the `main` branch [GIS examples](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa-examples/tree/main/gis) can be found will keep being updated for the latest Mesa and Mesa-Geo versions.
- On the `mesa-2.x` branch [GIS examples](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa-examples/tree/mesa-2.x/gis) examples can be found that keep working with Mesa 2.x and Mesa-Geo 0.8.x.

The Mesa-Geo 0.8.x. series is compatible with Mesa 2.3.x. The next Mesa-Geo release series, 0.9.x, will be compatible with with Mesa 3.0.
