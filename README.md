Mesa-Geo implements a `GeoSpace` that can host GIS-based `GeoAgents`, which are like normal Agents, except they have a `geometry` attribute that is a [Shapely object](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manual.html) and a `crs` attribute for its Coordinate Reference System. You can use `Shapely` directly to create arbitrary geometries, but in most cases you will want to import your geometries from a file. Mesa-Geo allows you to create GeoAgents from any vector data file (e.g. shapefiles), valid GeoJSON objects or a GeoPandas GeoDataFrame.

## Using Mesa-Geo

To install Mesa-Geo, run:
```bash
pip install -U mesa-geo
```

Mesa-Geo pre-releases can be installed with:
```bash
pip install -U --pre mesa-geo
```

You can also use `pip` to install the GitHub version:
```bash
pip install -U -e git+https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa-geo.git#egg=mesa-geo
```

Or any other (development) branch on this repo or your own fork:
``` bash
pip install -U -e git+https://github.com/YOUR_FORK/mesa-geo@YOUR_BRANCH#egg=mesa-geo
```

Take a look at the [examples](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa-examples/tree/main/gis) repository for sample models demonstrating Mesa-Geo features.
